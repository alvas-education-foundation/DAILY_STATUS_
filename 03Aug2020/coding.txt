1.Check if a triangle of positive area is possible with the given angles

def isTriangleExists(a, b, c):
    if(a != 0 and b != 0 and c != 0 and (a + b + c)== 180):  
        if((a + b)>= c or (b + c)>= a or (a + c)>= b):
            return "YES,triangle of positive area is possible with the given angles"
        else:
            return "NO,triangle of positive area is not possible with the given angles"
    else:
        return "NO,triangle of positive area is not possible with the given angles"
# Driver Code
a, b, c = 50, 70, 60
