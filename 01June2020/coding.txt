1.Write a Java Program to left rotate the elements of an array

Problem Description
In this program, we need to rotate the elements of an array towards the left by the specified number of times. In the left rotation, each element of the array will be shifted to its left by one position and the first element of the array will be added to end of the list. This process will be followed for a specified number of times.
Suppose if n is 1 then, all elements of the array will be moved to its left by one position such that second element of the array will take the first position, the third element will be moved to the second position and so on. The first element of the array will be added to the last of the array.

public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    int[] arr={1,2,3,4,5};
	    int n=3;
	    	System.out.println("Original Array");
	    	for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
	    		System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
	    	for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
	    	{
	    	    int first=arr[0];
	    	    int j=0;
	    	    for(j=0;j<arr.length-1;j++)
	    	    {
	    	    
	    	        arr[j]=arr[j+1];
	    	    }
	    	    arr[j]=first;
	    	    
	    	    
	    	}
	    	System.out.println();
	    	System.out.println("Array after left rotation");
	    	for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
		        System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
	}
}

2.Write a python program to remove duplicate elements from a list.

a = []
n = int(input("Enter the number of elements in list:"))
for x in range(0,n):
    element = int(input("Enter element" + str(x+1) + ":"))
    a.append(element)
b = set()
unique = []
for x in a:
    if x not in b:
        unique.append(x)
        b.add(x)
print("Non-duplicate items:")
print(unique)

3.Given an array of positive integers. Write a C Program to find the leaders in
the array. 
Note: An element of array is leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to
its right side. Also, the rightmost element is always a leader.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The
description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the
elements of the array.
Output:
Print all the leaders.
Constraints:
1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100
1 &lt;= N &lt;= 107
0 &lt;= Ai &lt;= 107
Example:
Input:
3
6
16 17 4 3 5 2
5
1 2 3 4 0
5
7 4 5 7 3
Output:
17 5 2
4 0
7 7 3
Explanation:
Testcase 3: All elements on the right of 7 (at index 0) are smaller than or equal to 7.
Also, all the elements of right side of 7 (at index 3) are smaller than 7. And, the last
element 3 is itself a leader since no elements are on its right.
